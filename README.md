# Coding Style Guide

A coding style guide. Mainly for my own use.

Though I call it a *coding* styleguide, it isn't strictly restricted to coding per se â€” the intention of this is to prepare a set of standards for my own self, and for that purpose, it will touch on anything and everything that I would face in my work as a Front-end Developer.

Alright, here we go.
